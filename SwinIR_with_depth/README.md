# Swin Transformer with Depth Estimation
This repository contains an implementation of the Swin Transformer architecture enhanced with depth estimation for image super-resolution. The Swin Transformer has emerged as a powerful model for various computer vision tasks, and by incorporating depth estimation, we aim to further improve the quality and visual fidelity of super-resolved images.
